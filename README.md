# Mario Kart Tour (Mobile Game) Helper App

## What is this?

It's going to be one of those trackers (skinned to-do lists, really) that help you plan what drivers, karts, and gliders you should level to best progress through the game. Since it's time-gated, anything that improves efficiency is going to be key, right?

## How do I use it?

You don't yet, hang on. The idea is that you'll be able to mark off which drivers, karts, and gliders you have and see which tracks they do and don't provide benefits for.

## How do I contribute?

If you want to datamine the .apk and send me whatever you find, I'll parse it. I'm not looking for contributors during the Mario Kart Tour CBT, but when the game launches that could change.
